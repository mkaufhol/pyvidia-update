# Pyvidia Update Checker

The Pyvidia Update checker is a simple python program for those, who installed the Nvidia Drivers on their
Windows System without the GeForce Experience app. Instead of checking the Nvidia Driver Download page
manually, the Pyvidia update checker can read your systems driver version and checks the current driver version
from the official Nvidia page.
